# Evaluation of random number generators and their properties
In this work I implement the linear congruential generator (LCG) random number generator (RNG), and assess it against the known properties of a quality RNG.

See `assignment2.pdf` for further details on the task and `Peter_Akioyamen_250949002_AS2.pdf` for completed analysis. `C++` and `matlab` were used.
